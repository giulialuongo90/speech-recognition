The purpose of the analysis is the training of models based on neural networks for speech recognition. Each word (30 in this dataset, in English) is associated with sequences that represent its "spoken" word.


The models can be used in the field of voice recognition, aimed at human-machine communication: some application examples could be voice assistants, the simultaneous transcription of spoken speech into text or even translation.
